========================
Ye Olde Adventure Shoppe
========================

"I've spent far, far too much of my life in dank, monster-infested dungeons, scavenging for loot, food and weapons."


Description:
------------

What if you were fed up with adventuring and decided to run the adventurers shop instead?

This is my entry for the coding part of the 2012 Liberated Pixel Cup competition.

The aim of the competition was to build some open source games that incorporate artwork from the artwork building phase of the project. 
My goal was to build a game that was NOT an RPG.

Note that this project is unfinished, there is currently no actual gameplay. It's just something to look at.

Things I would've liked to have implemented: 
- Actual buying and selling of goods. 
- Expanding the shop. Lazy employees. 
- Managing shop inventory and prices. 
- An in-game newspaper that affects product demand. 
- Dealing with thugs that want to extort money from your shop. 
- Etc.

All the code and assets are released under the GNU GPL 3.0 license and the CC BY-SA 3.0 License
That includes the LPC assets that I cleaned-up and re-coloured, and the additional art that I created for this game.
